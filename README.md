Group Members: Liam Sullivan, Anna Cavenaugh

## How to Install
1. Log into SCI JupyterHub and start a terminal
2. Type in 'git clone https://github.com/liambsulliva/partner-project.git' and hit the enter key
3. This should download a folder to your JupyterHub with the program in it (should be called partner-project)
4. Double click the new folder in the file explorer. You should see the program contents.
5. Launch the py file something.py
## How it works
This program takes two words, and combines them into a single phrase that separates the words by a space. It then yells at you for how lame your words are.
## How to Contribute
1. Copy the URL and fork it to your own GitHub account. Then 'git clone' it to your own directory.
2. Change it up! Add some code, add a text file, write a poem, do whatever you want. 'git add' any files you create, and 'git commit' them all to the repository. Then, 'git push origin main' away back to GitHub.
3. Create a pull request from your fork to the repository.
4. Wait for the request to be reviewed by our team.
5. If we deem your contribution fit for our project, it will be merged into the main repository.

### Why we decided on Covenant/GNU
We picked these two for our license and code of conduct because they are very general and used in many open source projects such as this one, and because we have no specific concerns that require a more extensive lincensing agreement. These two are sufficient for our purposes.
